# Issue Tracker 
IssueTracker is an intuitive and user-friendly issue (aka tickets, bugs, etc...) management tool for collaborators who are working in overlapping projects including software developers and students. 

## what kind of problem does ‘Issue Tracker’ solve 
The IssueTracker allows users to create projects and add other users to the project. Within each project, users can create and assign issues to other members of the project. Each user can easily access and manage their issues. They will also have a comprehensive overview of their on-going projects and status of the issues within each of their projects. 

## Motivation 
As prospective software developers/Computer Science students at Johns Hopkins University, we have tackled numerous projects in and out of the classrooms. While there were numerous services like github and Jira that aids the collaboration process, we found it rather challenging at the beginning for students like us to fully utilize the complex features of those services, and felt the need for a simple and intuitive issue management tool for developers as well as, really, any group of people who are involved in overlapping projects.
